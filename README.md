This is a beginner-friendly automation project using **SmartBear TestComplete**, built to demonstrate how to create structured, repeatable test scenarios for Windows desktop applications. It combines **keyword tests**, **name mapping**, **checkpoints**, and basic scripting techniques.

---

## 📌 Project Highlights

- ✅ Automates basic UI workflows in a sample desktop app
- ✅ Combines record/playback and modular scripting
- ✅ Implements checkpoints (property, region, table)
- ✅ Demonstrates data-driven testing (from CSV)
- ✅ Generates detailed test logs and screenshots
- ✅ Fully built using TestComplete's built-in tools

> ⚠️ Note: This project uses a generic sample app. You can replace it with your own executable under `TestedApps`.

Se quiser, posso também criar um exemplo genérico de `users.csv` e uma estrutura básica para uma aplicação fake de login. Deseja isso para enriquecer o projeto?
